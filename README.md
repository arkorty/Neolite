# About

Neolite is a fast and lightweight configuration of Neovim. For the uninitiated, Neovim is a terminal based text editor which can be extended using the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html) scripting language. Neovim out-of-the-box doesn't come with a lot of features, but it is highly extensible. It comes with native LSP support (lets your IDE do all that auto-completion magic). Vim has been in use since forever, so you don't have to worry about the project going stale anytime soon.

You also have the added benefit of becoming a true Vim chad once you start using Neovim instead of some web browser (ahem.. VS Code) disguised as an IDE.
